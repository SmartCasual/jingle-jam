# Contributing

## Getting set up

Please see the README.md for setup instructions.

## Guidance

- Please check existing pull requests before creating new ones
- All commits must be [GPG signed](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) before they can be merged
- Please follow these [commit](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md) and [pull request](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/pull-requests.md) styleguides (where applicable)
- Don't be afraid to ask questions, we're happy to answer them, and our Discord server is here: https://discord.gg/6eEcfJQzzy
- If you're looking for a first project, have a look at the TODOs scattered throughout the code and see if any look doable to you

And finally, please keep backseating to a minimum.  All suggestions and contributions are welcome, but please don't get upset if we don't do things exactly how you would do them.
